         <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">I am not stating that as a scientist because I am definitely not one but I do think it is an important topic to discuss. 
            I will be discussing this idea in regards to where we are in terms of environmental sustainability based on research of the subject  and the environmental messaging and practices I&#39;ve personally experienced.</p>
         <p>So should we just stop recycling? This idea, like most of my ideas, was inspired by frustration. In a recent chat I had with a friend we shared our mutual frustrations with the recycling programs in our respective cities and how the policies didn&#39;t seem to cover all the purchasable products. The biggest issue, we both shared, being with plastic grocery bags. The most common item in both our households and probably your household as well. In fact according to the 2019 book &#34;Plastic Soup&#34; by Michiel Abbing its estimated that 1 million plastic bags are used every minute worldwide. This item, which is everywhere, has no proper disposal system. </p>

         </figure>

         <p>So I went to check, whats the deal with no recycling plastic bags? The Recycle by City website states that bags in general, not just grocery bags, hurt the processing side of recycling by preventing sorters and haulers from seeing contents and disabling sorting equipment by getting wrapped around machines and gumming up the processing effectively shutting down the entire recycling facility as crew have to cut and saw hundreds of plastic bags off of equipment.</p>
         <p>So plastic bags are a problem for consumers and recyclers.
            And plastic bags are such an environmental hazard that some countries and cities have outright banned them. Or in the case of my Chicago friend added a bag tax to try to legislate better behavior. Even so 13 million tons of plastic makes its way into the ocean killing wildlife and poisoning the environment.</p>
         <p>The environment is where I keep my stuff. It&#39;s what we need to live. Recycling, we&#39;ve been told, is just one of the many things we have to do to sustain our environment.</p>
         <p>So, where are we in terms of environmental sustainability? Well lets define environmental sustainability 
            The Brundtland Report defines sustainable development as &#34;—-development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.&#34;</p>
         <p>So are we there yet?</p>
         <p>And according to the Paris climate agreement if we dont lower emissions by at least 3&percnt; each year we face irreversible global warming. Global warming that leads to extreme weather catastrophes and large scale migration as people escape draught, flooding, and untenable land.</p>
         <p>But there is some positive news as the cost of renewable energies is cheaper than processing fossil fuels. This is due to the ramp up in manufacturing and designing renewable energy technology. However that is in potential only as 26 percent of global electricity is using renewable sources. Add to that fossil fuel consumption has been steadily growing in countries with developing economies like China. And though NASA reports that the COVID lockdowns have dropped pollutions levels by 20&percnt; there is a slow return to the status quo.</p>

         </figure>
         <p>So whats the solution? Well I think we should stop recycling and instead start reimagining. In addition to a push to for individuals to take more responsibility there should be a push for businesses to become more sustainable as well. including solutions at each stage of the product life cycle could solve issues before they arise.</p>
         <p>In regards to my example of plastic bags the scale of impact an individual consumer is insignificant as there isn&#39;t even a complete life cycle for thin plastics. However I think we can break the problem apart.</p>
            <ul>
               <li>Where plastic bags are the only option we shoppers need to know the composition of the bag and where it was made and if those processes and materials are sustainable. </li>
               <li>Where Paper brown bags are available they can help  alleviate the plastic issue but present other environmental issues created by destroying and processing trees. </li>
               <li>Reusable totes help as well but must be used a minimum of 52 times to compensate for the carbon footprint of manufacturing such products.</li>
            </ul>
         <p>Consumers must be empowered with this information and more options from producers and retailers to make the most educated decisions for sustainability. Every informed generation can help protect the planet and create opportunities for future generations to build on. </p>
